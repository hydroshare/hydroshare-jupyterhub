    "Initializing carbon and nitrogen stores is a multi-step process that involves running LAI read to generate a redefine worldfile, running a 3-day RHESSys simulation to incorporate the redefine worldfile, writing out a new worldfile with initialized vegetation carbon and nitrogen stores. RHESSysWorkflows automates all of these processes for you using the tool RunLAIRead, which can even figure out what date to start the 3-day RHESSys simulation on based on your climate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the current version of RHESSysWorkflows, RunLAIRead is only able to read simulation start dates from point time-series climate data. Users of ASCII or NetCDF gridded climate data must run LAI read by hand. The next release of RHESSysWorkflows will add support for gridded climate data to RunLAIRead.\n",
    "\n",
    "To initialize vegetation carbon and nitrogen stores, LAIread relies on allometric relationships between leaf area and carbon and nitrogen mass in various plant tissues (e.g. leaf, stem, root). Consult the RHESSys wiki for more information on allometric relationships used by LAIread. These allometric parameters have not yet been added to the RHESSys ParamDB database proper. A default version of the parameters for RHESSys base vegetation classes is stored in the RHESSys ParamDB source coderepository. RHESSysWorkflows stores this file under the name allometric.txt in the allometry folder of the ParamDB of your rhessys/db folder. \n"
